### what's this self awareness thing

So there was this tweet, https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1610879587319177216, about self awareness and i realized i didn't know what it was or if it was important, so figured i'd make this repo to figure out wtf it was and what happened if we gave it to an agent.

So I don't know all that much about what self awareness means, but i figure that we can see what it looks like for something to be aware of it's own thoughts by having an agent that;
1) has a thought-state
2) has some function F that evaluates that thought state
3) F is able to put into that thought-state that F has evaluated that thought state

I don't particularly expect anything crazy to emerge out of this (and particularly, i suspect that people think the emerging self awareness is the intersting bit not forcing it in like this) but i figure it's worth playing with to try to figure out what it even looks like and how it works.

#### important!
I don't know javascript so this should be fun
